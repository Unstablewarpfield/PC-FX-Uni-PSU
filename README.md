Universal power solution for the NEC PC-fx. In this repository I'll post:

- Gerbers (done)
- Schematics (done)
- BOM (done)
- Basic installation instructions/photo's (to be done)
 
I strongly advise against using any other PSU than the original one, unless there is a clear reason as to why you'd want to ditcht the stock PSU (e.g. a broken unit).
